# Dark-Souls-Like-Game-Project
First foray into 3D Game Design, started in Late May of 2022

This is a showcase of the game progress I've made over May till July 2022.

## Summary

I embarked on this project as a way to learn Unity3D. Most of what I've learnt comes from Youtube videos.

I had initially planned to create my own 3D models using Blender but after creating my first character model, I realized that making my own assets would take me way too long to accomplish what I wanted to do with the limited time I had. 

My goal over 2022 summer break was to learn as much as I can about game development and gain insights about how certain things are accomplished.

Although I was initially hesitant to use paid assets, I ultimately feel that some of the assets have helped serve as an introduction to some of the ways that certain features are implemented. 

It was pretty fun doing the UI as well, albeit rather tedious and monotonous at times.

I would like to think that I have learnt quite a bit from this project, and I look forward to learning more from industry professionals

# 29/7/22: Updated UI Elements
Added the yellow bar thingy to display damage dealth to health, stamina and mana.

Updated the Inventory UI (basically copied Elden Ring's Inventory UI)

Most stats do not have an actual gameplay effect to them yet.

PS: Enemies are not present as I was trying to refactor them and improve their AI logic but it was more work than I initially expected so they were replaced with a glowing red ball XD
